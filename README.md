RNArank is a deep learning framework for assessing the quality of RNA 3D structures. It employs a Y-shaped deep residual neural network that processes 1D, 2D, and 3D features extracted from an input RNA structure to predict its quality.

Starting from an RNA structure in PDB format, the RNArank pipeline comprises the following steps:

1. **Feature Preparation**: Extracts features from the input RNA PDB structure.
2. **Map Prediction**: A Y-shaped network processes these multi-dimensional features to predict intermediate contact and deviation maps.
3. **Score Calculation**: The predicted maps are used to derive a per-residue predicted lDDT (pLDDT) score, which reflects the local accuracy of the model.

Installation
----
### Step 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YangLab-SDU/RNArank.git
cd RNArank
```
This will create a params/ directory containing the necessary model weights.

### Step 2. Environment installation
It is recommended to use `mamba` to manage the Python dependencies, which can be installed following [Mamba Installation â€” documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). You can use [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) instead, but Mamba is highly recommended as it's much faster. If you already have Conda installed, please install Mamba into the base environment with `conda install -n base mamba -c conda-forge` to avoid potential conflicts, rather than performing a separate Mamba installation.

Once the `mamba` is installed, a new environment can be created and activated: 
```bash
### tested on our devices with CUDA 12.4 and 11.2 ###
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate RNArank
```

### Step 3. Download the network weights
```bash
wget http://yanglab.qd.sdu.edu.cn/RNArank/download/RNArank_params.tar.gz
tar -xvzf RNArank_params.tar.gz
```
This will create a params/ directory containing the necessary model weights.

Usage
----

### Running RNArank
The main script Predict.py performs structure assessment. It supports both single-sample and batch modes.

**Predicting a Single RNA Structure**

To assess a single PDB file, provide the path to the file.

```bash
python RNArank/Predict.py --pdb ./example/example1.pdb --output_dir ./example/output/
```
RNArank will output the predicted global and per-residue lDDT scores. The results will be saved in example/output/example1_plDDT.txt.

**Predicting Multiple RNA Structures (Batch Mode)**

To assess all PDB files within a directory, provide the path to the directory.

```bash
python RNArank/Predict.py --pdb ./example/ --output_dir ./example/output/
```

For each input structure, the predicted scores will be saved to a separate .txt file within the example/output/ directory.
